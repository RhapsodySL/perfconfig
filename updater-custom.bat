REM | This is the auto-updater. Read the notes in the README.MD file to know how to use this properly.
REM | This updater detects if you run a 64-bit or 32-bit operating system, and lets you install to where you want to.
REM | If you just want to write the config to autoexec.cfg then just use the regular updater.
REM | NOTE: You must run this manually once before setting the task!

REM | Final note; I haven't actually tested the 32-bit line since I don't have a 32-bit OS. If this doesn't work properly,
REM | then please add an issue on the github page at https://github.com/RhapsodySL/perfconfig. Thanks.
